/*
* This is (mostly) the OpMode used in the goBILDA Robot in 3 Days for the 24-25 Into The Deep FTC Season.
* https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpytbFEB5mLcWxf6rOHqbmYjDi9BbK00p&si=NyQLwyIkcZvZEirP (playlist of videos)
* I've gone through and added comments for clarity. But most of the code remains the same.
* This is very much based on the code for the Starter Kit Robot for the 24-25 season. Those resources can be found here:
* https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-bot-resource-guide-into-the-deep/
*
* There are three main additions to the starter kit bot code, mecanum drive, a linear slide for reaching
* into the submersible, and a linear slide to hang (which we didn't end up using)
*
* the drive system is all 5203-2402-0019 (312 RPM Yellow Jacket Motors) and it is based on a Strafer chassis
* The arm shoulder takes the design from the starter kit robot. So it uses the same 117rpm motor with an
* external 5:1 reduction
*
* The drivetrain is set up as "field centric" with the internal control hub IMU. This means
* when you push the stick forward, regardless of robot orientation, the robot drives away from you.
* We "took inspiration" (copy-pasted) the drive code from this GM0 page
* (PS GM0 is a world class resource, if you've got 5 mins and nothing to do, read some GM0!)

    But we also have an internal gear reduction in our motor.
    The motor we use for this arm is a 117RPM Yellow Jacket. Which has an internal gear
    reduction of ~50.9:1. (more precisely it is 250047/4913:1)
    We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.
    The motor's encoder counts 28 times per rotation. So in total you should see about 7125.16

    In these variables you'll see a number in degrees, multiplied by the ticks per degree of the arm.
    This results in the number of encoder ticks the arm needs to move in order to achieve the ideal
    set position of the arm. For example, the ARM_SCORE_SAMPLE_IN_LOW is set to
    160 * ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE. This asks the arm to move 160Â° from the starting position.
